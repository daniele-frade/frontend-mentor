### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Why do flex-item images not scale height?
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43759448/image-doesnt-scale-inside-flexbox
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35142847/why-do-flex-item-images-not-scale-height

I had an image inside a flex item that I was expecting to auto-scale to full height, 
but it was not hapenning. After researching and testing, I came up with the same solution
as the one mentioned in the first link above: giving the image "display: block;".
It seems to be a quirky thing with flexbox.
