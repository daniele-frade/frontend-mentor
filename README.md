Product Preview Card: [Live Site URL](https://astonishing-tartufo-e6fdee.netlify.app) | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/daniele-frade/frontend-mentor/tree/main/product-preview-card) | [Frontend Mentor Solution Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/html-and-css-layout-using-flexbox-QJU_BaHi-K)

- In this project the main goal was to learn and practice more CSS Flexbox on a landing page.
- I also had a challenge which was to learn how scale height on flex-item images. I had an image inside a flex item that I was expecting to auto-scale to full height, but it was not hapenning. After researching and testing, I came up with the same solution as the one mentioned in the link below: giving the image "display: block;". It seems to be a quirky thing with flexbox.
